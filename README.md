## ExplodeMe
A very simple Minecraft Spigot plugin to prevent other players from being damaged when players explode end crystals, beds, or respawn anchors. Damage will still be applied to the player who caused the explosion (as well as the surrounding blocks and entities).

Use the `/emreload` command to reload config file.
